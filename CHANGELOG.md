# FarmHud Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Bug Fixes

- **GatherMate2 Icons Not Aligning** - The HUD now properly sets the global `Minimap` variable while active so that addons relying on `Astrolabe` correctly center and draw distance relative to the screen.
- **Graceful Restoration** - Restores the exact globally mapped `Minimap` back to its original state rather than relying on standard names, preventing errors across different UI profiles.

---

## [2.0.9] - 2026-01-25

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Camera Rotation Block** - Resolved an issue where closing the HUD would leave invisible frames (FarmHudMapCluster and FarmHud) interactive, preventing the user from right-clicking to rotate the camera in the center of the screen.

---

## [2.0.8] - 2026-01-20

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed LootCollector Pin Scaling** - Corrected a scaling mismatch where LootCollector pins would appear to "slide" or move with the player because they weren't inheriting the HUD's 1.4x scale.
- **Fixed LootCollector Dynamic Pins** - Added a hook to LootCollector's `UpdateMinimap` to ensure that newly created pins (from spatial hashing) are immediately parented to the HUD proxy, resolving issues where some pins would act inconsistently or rotate incorrectly.

 ---

## [2.0.7] - 2026-01-01

### New Features

- **Questie Integration** - Questie 3.3.5 quest objective pins now display on FarmHud
- **Addon Pins Options** - New options panel section to toggle addon pins on/off:
  - Questie, GatherMate2, Routes, LootCollector, NPCScan Overlay, HandyNotes, Carbonite
  - Each toggle shows addon icon and is disabled if addon not installed
  - All addons enabled by default

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Questie pin rotation** - Pins now stay fixed in world position instead of rotating with player view
- **Added SetZoom to AddonPinProxy** - Prevents nil error when Questie checks indoor/outdoor zoom levels

---

## [2.0.6] - 2025-12-25

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed stack overflow with MinimapButtonFrame** - Added recursion guard to prevent infinite loop when both FarmHud and MBF iterate over `Minimap:GetChildren()` simultaneously

---

## [2.0.5] - 2025-12-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed TrailPath pins not appearing on HUD** - Pins were parented to wrong frame (FarmHud XML frame instead of FarmHudMapCluster container)

---

## [2.0.4] - 2025-12-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed TrailPath module display** - Pins now show on HUD, minimap, and world map
- **Fixed 3.3.5a parentKey incompatibility** - Added SetupPinStructure helper to manually assign pin structure
- **Fixed all TrailPath options** - Scale, icon, color, minimap toggle, count, and timeout now work correctly
- Safe animation access to prevent errors when pin.Facing animation is missing

---

## [2.0.3] - 2025-12-15

### New Features

- **TrailPath module enabled** - Shows a trail of where you've been on the HUD, minimap, and world map

### Technical Changes

- Fixed `C_Timer.NewTicker` → OnUpdate frame pattern (native 3.3.5a)
- Fixed `C_CVar.GetCVarBool` → `GetCVar()` (native 3.3.5a)
- Added module OnShow/OnHide dispatch in FarmHud.lua
- Added module event dispatch (PLAYER_LOGIN, PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD, etc.)

---

## [2.0.2] - 2025-12-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed ElvUI instances panel appearing in HUD** - Added direct hiding of ElvUI minimap-related frames:
  - `LayerPickerFrame` (instance selector)
  - `RightMiniPanel`, `LeftMiniPanel`
  - `MinimapPanel`, `MinimapButtonFrame`
  - `MiniMapInstanceDifficulty`, `GuildInstanceDifficulty`

---

## [2.0.1] - 2025-12-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed duplicate inner circle** - Removed hardcoded gatherCircle texture (SPELLS\CIRCLE.BLP) that was always visible regardless of Range Circles settings
- **Fixed CardinalPoints module** - Created FarmHud.TextFrame wrapper for 3.3.5a compatibility since XML parentKey/parentArray don't work
- **Fixed ElvUI compatibility** - Wrapped Minimap:SetZoom in pcall to prevent resetZoom nil errors
- **Fixed XML/Lua load order** - Created FarmHud_Mixins.lua to ensure mixin stubs exist before XML loads
- **Fixed nil reference errors** - Added nil checks throughout CardinalPoints module

### Technical Changes

- New file: `FarmHud_Mixins.lua` - Contains mixin stubs for XML scripts
- Updated TOC load order: Mixins → XML → FarmHud.lua
- FarmHud.lua now references XML-defined FarmHud frame instead of creating duplicate
- Added rot/NWSE properties to cardinal direction font strings
